      <p class="about-text cushycms">Holder Law Group specializes in environmental law and land use. Its core goals are to promote and enforce laws protecting the natural environment and open and accountable government, and to provide the highest quality representation at reasonable
        rates to clients seeking to improve and revitalize neighborhoods or help sustain and protect natural resources. We serve our clients diligently, responsibly, and with attention and sensitivity to their specific needs and objectives.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>Principal attorney Jason Holder assists a wide range of clients in cases concerning compliance with environmental statutes, including the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Clean Water
        Act, and state and federal Endangered Species Acts. He has helped public agencies and private clients comply with these laws. Conversely, he has helped project opponents and concerned citizens meaningfully participate in the environmental review
        process and in litigation to minimize and mitigate project impacts. These divergent experiences provide a balanced perspective and keen insights into opposing strategies. Holder Law Group strives to provide efficient and effective advocacy to
        address client needs.</p>
